# AsgardJs SDK

Welcome to the AsgardJs SDK! This SDK provides tools and libraries to integrate with the Asgard AI platform.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, visit: [Asgard AI Documentation](https://www.asgard-ai.com/docs/intigration-with-asgard/intigration-with-api)

## Installation

To install the SDK, use the following command:

```sh
yarn add asgardjs-sdk
```

## Building the Package

To build the core and react packages, run:

```sh
yarn build:core
yarn build:react
```

## Testing

To run tests for the core and react packages, use:

```sh
yarn test:core
yarn test:react
```

## Serving the React Demo

To serve the react-demo for development, execute:

```sh
yarn serve:react-demo
```

## Development

To start developing with the core and react packages, use:

```sh
yarn watch:core
yarn watch:react
```

This will watch both projects and trigger hot reloads for the react-demo dev server.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the SDK:

```javascript
import { AsgardServiceClient } from 'asgardjs-sdk';

const client = new AsgardServiceClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  endpoint: 'https://api.asgard-ai.com',
});

// Use the client to interact with the Asgard AI platform
```

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/js?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
